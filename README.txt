Hello, 

Thank you for using my discord PTT app made for the use with OVRtool kit in Pavlov. 

Follow the instructions below to get up and running!

1. Install the program
2. Edit the App.Config file using an editor. Set value next to keybind to what key (single letter) you want to use as your PTT button. Then set the modifier if you would like to use one as well. (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT). Set the theme (dark or light) and color (lime, black, blue ,brown, green, magenta, orange, pink, purple, red, silver, teal, white, or yellow)
3. Save this file then set a "Toggle Mute" keybind in discord to the command you put in above. 
4. Run the program and try it out. You will need to sync the setting of your mic currently and the program. 
5. Optional: Set the window to be behind your hand in VR if you wish to hide it. 

If you have any questions, you can contact me on discord at Ace#1277 but this is a hobby of mine so don't be suprised if I sometimes take a bit to reply.
